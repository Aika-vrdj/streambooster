Stream Booster is a VST3 plugin, a small software that modifies audio.
This plugin improves the sound of your audio sources, whether its your voice, music or video game.
Technically, this plugin adds a limiters, gain, equalizers and compressors to make the sound better, cleaner and louder. 

The plugin has two parts, the upper part is best used for music and video games. 
The lower part is best for microphone and voice. 

This plugin is in beta so it will be improved over time!
